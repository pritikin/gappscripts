There are two files here:

| file          | what is it | 
|---------------|------------------------|
|code.gs        | the main script        |
|ObjService.gs  | http://goo.gl/JdEHW    |

To use this setup these as the scripts for your doc by using Tools | Script Editor and then:

1) place your cursor in the doc where you want all the data
2) in script editor hit "run"
3) go to the doc and hit OK 
4) wait/watch as all the sections are added

TODOs are many:

1) if this was going to be around a long time I'd think about how best to integrate into a real workflow. Many a menu option and maybe a tagged section that automatically gets replaced. 

2) perhaps make it a library so i can publish easily in google ecosystem

none of that seems worth it right now
